Then he changed the hospital to work one after another to look for her, and finally he met her again at the St. Cattleya Hospital. However, her attitude was remote and his love couldnt be fulfilled. To make the matter worse, he received photograph on which Ren was molested. Ren had been turned into a lewd woman by Hirasaka by the woman body experiment when she was at the St. Julianna Hospital. He was disappointed and he lost his mind. Kazama Mana who was a nurse of the gynecology and obstetrics section, loved Kuwahara, and she resembled Ren. Taking advantage of her thoughts, Kuwahara raped her and deprived her virginity shouting the name of Ren.<br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

    "description": "After Aoi Zip Formula was banned for one year from Cyber Formula racing due to cheating, Jotaro Kaga, alias Bleed Kaga, returns for the 17th Cyber Formula World Grand Prix. However his old car is no match for the returning champion Hayato Kazami, whose skill has improved tremendously, and his Nu-Asurada AKF-0. An old face, Kyoshiro Nagumo, appears suddenly to him and offers him the Ogre AN-21: a prototype to the Bio-Computer operated Al-Zard series created by the developers of the Asurada, and an ultimate racing machine that only a few can drive. Kaga must now master this car, confront his own inner demons and, most importantly, defeat his longtime rival Hayato in what is possibly Kaga's last and greatest Cyber Formula season.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Living in a less-developed part of the flying colony City 7 which is looking for a habitable planet, he composes and sings songs in the belief that music holds a greater power.<br><br>\nDuring its flight, an unknown alien race appeared and started laying siege upon City 7. However, its attacks are not conventional -- instead of trying to destroy them, they steal what is known as \"spiritia\", rendering victims unresponsive and zombie-like. During these battles, Basara always goes out into the middle of the warzone, singing his songs and expecting friend and foe to listen and be moved by his music.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

    "description": "Hard-boiled, cocky, classy and silly. These words only begin to describe the amazing master thief Lupin the Third. With the help of some quick gunplay by his partner Jigen, Lupin takes on the world in elaborate heists, classic car chases, and nasty explosions. Fujiko, a buxom redhead with a penchant for betrayal, always gets tangled up in Lupin's capers. The stoic but swift swordsman Goemon is just as inclined to kill Lupin as he is to help him. And Lupin can never seem to lose the relentless Tokyo Police Inspector Zenigata. What sort of trouble will this band of misfits get into next?<br><br>\n(Source: Discotek Media)",

Through their exploration of the island, the trio encounters the lethal &ldquo;Nanomachine,&rdquo; the island&rsquo;s security system. The trio triggers the alarm, springing &ldquo;the Nanomachine&rdquo; to life. The key to solving the island&rsquo;s mystery lies in the small nation of Zufu. This once prosperous nation is now ruled by the ruthless, knife-collecting, General Headhunter. Fujiko does her usual probing and hacks into General Headhunter&rsquo;s computer hoping to find some crucial information. Zenigata has received a video message from Lupin in which Lupin announces his desire for the priceless treasure. Oleander, a fiery blond officer with some hidden secrets of her own, steps in to help Zenigata. Armed with their newly found information, Lupin, Goemon, Jigen, and Fujiko go back to &ldquo;Drifting Island,&rdquo; but this time they are followed by General Headhunter.<br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNewsNetwork)",

But it's only half of the treasure-the other half of the Twilight can be found in Morocco. But it's not as simple as \"X marks the spot\" when a civil uprising is broiling between two factions in this desert paradise. Lupin must contend with his sometimes-partner Fujiko, his feelings for the gorgeous brunette Lara, and on top of it all, the relentless whip-wielding maniac Sadachiyo.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Discotek Media)",
