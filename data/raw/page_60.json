However, what was supposed to be a simple school project becomes much more complicated when he's attacked by two supernatural beings known as \"the nue\" and \"the yakou\" and loses the vision in his left eye. After he's saved from the nue by a girl named Kuchiha, he realizes that he's no longer wearing the simulation goggles, and is trapped in the virtual Edo. <br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

    "description": "2061 AD. Fifty years have passed since mankind developed the Network society. It was anticipated that this new infrastructure would realize a utopia where people connected with each other at the level of consciousness. However, new social problems such as personal data leaks and proliferation of manipulated information began to surface. Nevertheless, people still relied on the Network to exchange information, and proved unable to opt to abandon it.<br><br>\nIn due course, a new Network realm with more effective security measures was developed. This was called Meta Real Network, usually abbreviated as \"the Metal.\"<br><br>\nThe Metal accommodated personal memory data within protected virtual stand-alone organic cyber enclaves called bubble shells and eventually pervaded the everyday lives of people.<br><br>\nHowever, people gradually learned to release and explode their instincts within the secure environment of the Metal. The unleashed instincts pushed each individual's consciousness to drown in the sea of information and to be exposed to the pressures of desire. Meanwhile, norms and regulations continued to bind their real world lives. Thus, strange friction between the two worlds began to manifest themselves as aberrations beyond the bounds of the imaginable.<br><br>\nExperts who challenged the deep sea of the Metal to investigate and decipher such aberrations were called cyber divers.<br><br>\nThis is a story of a cyber diver, Masamichi Haru, who investigates the incidents that lie between Reality and the Metal.<br><br>\n(Source: Production I.G)",

    "description": "In the year 1999, humanity begins to advance beyond the solar system. The leader of the planet Gishin, Emperor Zule, aims to conquer the galaxy and ends up in a conflict with Earth as a result. In an act aimed to eliminate the Earth, he sends a baby named Mars to live among humanity. Mars is accompanied by Gaia, a giant robot that utilizes a new power source strong enough to destroy an entire planet. Once Mars grows up, he will destroy the Earth by activating the bomb within Gaia. However, upon arriving on Earth, Mars is adopted into a Japanese family and given the name Takeru. Seventeen years later, Takeru has grown a love for humanity and he refuses to detonate the bomb as ordered by Zule. However, the bomb within Gaia is set to explode if Takeru were ever to die, which would ultimately result in the Earth's destruction.<br><br>\nTakeru possesses psychic powers (ESP) and decides to join the Earth defense forces and becomes a member of the Crasher Squad (an elite space defense force) where he and his friends take a stand against the Gishin attack.<br><br>\nUnknown to the Gishin, five other robots were created in secrecy along side Gaia by Takeru's father and sent with Gaia to protect Takeru. The five other robots are Sphinx, Uranus, Titan, Shin and Ra. Whenever Earth is in danger, Takeru is able to summon the five other robots to combine with Gaia form the giant robot Godmars. ",

Unfortunately for our good guy, he was born into a martial arts family whose head (ie his father) only knows one language: violence. When Koushi was still a baby, his father made a pact with his biggest rival to marry Koushi to his opponent-turned-friend's daughter. The union of the two blood lines is supposed to bring forth Earth's strongest martial arts clan.<br><br>\nSkip forward: Koushi is in high school, oblivious to the marriage arranged for him at his birth. Enter Momoko Kuzuryuu: sugar bomb, airhead, loli martial arts artist and Koushi's self-proclaimed bride (the strongest on Earth, no less). Her wish for sexual intercourse meets with Koushi's square refusal as he has absolutely no desire to get it on with someone who looks like she could be his little sister, not to mention that he doesn't have the foggiest idea who she actually is.<br><br>\nMeanwhile, a war has broken out between the martial arts families. For Koushi, this means that numerous fighters are out to challenge him. As if that weren't bad enough, our protagonist also has a fight phobia due to a traumatic incident that took place in his childhood. Now it's up to Momoko and her superhuman fighting skills to protect her \"husband.\" Will the two sweethearts survive the trials and tribulations ahead of them? More importantly, will Momoko get her way receiving a baby from Koushi?",

It relates Sana's troubles with Hayama at school as a result of the \"oyakodon baka\" situation and culminates when Hayama's dad and sister realize their mistakes thanks to Sana's efforts. <br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",
