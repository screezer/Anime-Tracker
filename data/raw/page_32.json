    "description": "Clannad is set in a high-school located in some Japanese town. Okazaki Tomoya is a third-year student who doesn't take his studies seriously. Always late for class, he's seen as a delinquent by the rest of his classmates who are busy preparing for their entrance examinations. Needless to say, he hasn't too many close friends either.<br><br>\nTomoya seems not to mind too - until one day he meets a girl, Furukawa Nagisa, who is left alone without friends on this school, because everybody she knew already graduated. What a clumsy girl, he thinks at first. But he can't leave her alone and so, while helping her, he meets a few other girls from his school. Although he doesn't care much about them at first, he soon opens his heart to them as they get to know each other better.<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

    "description": "The third season of <i>Maria-sama ga Miteru</i>.<br>\n<br>\nSummer has arrived at last, and with it comes the promise of summer break for the students of Lillian Girls’ Academy. Sachiko and Yumi retreat to the summer home of the Ogasawara family for a season of rest and relaxation, but their rosy trip soon sours when some old friends of Sachiko’s unexpectedly drop in. These wealthy snobs turn up their noses at Yumi and Sachiko’s relationship — and if Yumi isn’t careful, her blissful summer at Sachiko’s side could come to an abrupt and tearful end.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Maiden Japan)",

The story revolves around an older and slightly more matured Uzumaki Naruto and his quest to save his friend Uchiha Sasuke from the grips of the snake-like Shinobi, Orochimaru. After 2 and a half years Naruto finally returns to his village of Konoha, and sets about putting his ambitions to work, though it will not be easy, as he has amassed a few (more dangerous) enemies, in the likes of the shinobi organization; Akatsuki. <br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

    "description": "Marin Reigan lost his father and his home when Gattler staged a coup, forcing their people to abandon their dying planet and invade another. Seeking vengeance, Marin pursued. But when he saw the world they planned to invade, Marin found a new mission: to protect the untarnished skies and seas of that blue planet--Earth!\n<br><br>\nThe battle will not be easy. Marin's technology is the only thing that can stand against Gattler's forces. But the Earthlings are not quick to trust him, and the ruthless enemy commander Aphrodia is hungry for vengeance of her own. Can Marin gain the Earthlings' trust, avenge his father, and stop the war? \n<br><br>\n(Source: Discotek Media)<br><br>\n<i>Note: Originally planned and scripted for 39 episodes, the series was cancelled with various reasons cited including lack of anime magazine coverage and constant airtime changes. The 31st and last episode to air was actually produced as episode 32. Three unaired completed episodes (31, 33, 34) were later released on LaserDisc/DVD/Blu-ray, and the finished scripts and storyboards for the final 5 episodes had been shared in various magazines and a deluxe book.</I>",

Shiba-wanko is a very gentle and hardworking soul who does all of the cleaning, laundry and cooking in the house. Miike-nyanko is a different type all together, being rather temperamental and not very good with housework. Together, these two learn the manners and customs associated with events such as the proper Japanese way to treat one`s guests, preparing for a Japanese New Year and how to enjoy the kimono, the traditional Japanese costume. Each chapter covers a specific topic which has to do with living in \"Wa\" (the Japanese-style spirit of peace and harmony) throughout the changing seasons.<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

    "description": "After Japan's economic bubble burst the country slowly recovered, but dirty politicians still make deals with dirty businessmen so that they can both profit from the hard work of others. Keiichi Suzuki, head of Oshika Construction, and Seijiro Matsuzaka, one of the members of parliament, have a deal going on that allows Oshika Construction to use fewer materials in their projects while still letting their buildings get approved for business use. Unfortunately for them, the Government Crime Investigation Agency, the Japanese government-approved but independently-run equivalent to the FBI, is already on the move. Jotaro Zaizen, a long-thought-dead police officer, is the agent on the Ōshika case and gathers a group of people who have reasons to fight Suzuki and Matsuzaka. To help combat the GCIA, though, Suzuki hires the Haoukokuryu-kai, a yakuza group.",

When it comes to boys, however, she is hopelessly shy. <br><br>\nOne day, on her way home from school, Kaede walks into a mysterious shop and buys a colorful cocoa mug. When she reaches home, she casually peeks into the bottom of the mug and discovers an engraved note, which says, \"If you read this message aloud while pouring hot cocoa into the mug, a love fairy (\"muglox\") will appear and grant your every wish.\" The skeptical but curious Kaede follows the directions and announces her wish to date Yuuki, the class heartthrob. Suddenly, the adorable blue Mirumo appears! We soon find out, however, that this cute little muglox would rather eat chocolate and create mischief than help Kaede. <br><br>\nMirumo, it seems, is prince of the muglox world. Horrified at the prospect of having to marry Rirumu, his princess bride-to-be, Mirumo has escaped the muglox world. Hot on his heels, however, are Rirumu, Yashichi the bounty hunter, and a cast of hundreds of muglox ranging from the good to the bad to the nutty. This gang of adorable troublemakers will see to it that school life for Kaede and her friends is never the same... <br><br>\n(Source: mirmo-zibang) ",
