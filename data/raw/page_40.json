Still, a little challenge every now and again stimulates the mind and makes life so much more interesting, so she's willing to give it a shot.<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

    "description": "Yukiya Ayase is a gentle, kind hearted, and innocent university student. The only relative he has left, his cousin Tetsuo, betrays Ayase by selling him to the highest bidder in an auction with hopes of making an enormous profit to be able to pay off his debts. Somuku Kanou, a bad-tempered (though very rich) loan shark, comes to Ayase's rescue and buys Ayase for an impressive 1.2 billion. Kanou apparently knows Ayase from something that happened between them in the past, but Ayase cannot remember who Kanou is nor does he understand why he \"saved\" him. In a desperate effort to keep Ayase close to him, Kanou demands the debt be repaid in full and suggests the perfect way to do it: by selling his body to Kanou for 500,000 each time. Ayase is horrified in the beginning, but something soon begins to grow between them that can't be bought for any price.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

    "description": "One morning, Wataru Hoshino found a sleeping girl - in nothing but her underwear - in his room. When she woke up, she quickly escaped by jumping out of the window, but not without punching Wataru in the face first. This girl, Rinna Sawaki, ends up being a transfer student of Wataru's school, as well as the new roommate of Wataru's dormitory. <br><br>\nWataru lives with four other girls and their school teacher, but due to Temizugawa Heavy Industry's cancellation of their aviation branch - South Sakojima Island's major company - the families involved with the corporation have to be evacuated in one year. As a result of this, the four girls have to leave the island in one year's time. <br><br>\nKnowing this, Rinna refuses to become friends with Wataru and the other girls, because of the pain that she might experience as a result of their eventual separation. However, Wataru disagrees with her, and over the course of the year, tries to convince her otherwise.<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

The battle with Nobunaga is over, the city restored to peace...until the owner of Little Lip Theater informs Shinjiro... \"This time, the leading lady will be...you.\" Thus Shinjiro, disguised as the actress Petitmint, is forced into the role of \"Cleopatra.\" The Star Division members set out to persuade a reluctant Shinjiro, beginning a chase across the five boroughs. Meanwhile, a dark-skinned youth and his servant have appeared unexpectedly in the midst of the flourishing city. His eyes, concealing a silent wrath, are fixed upon nothing less than the Statue of Liberty. Now Shinjiro and company must protect this city of hopes and dreams from a new menace while safely raising the curtain on a new show.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

The two tribes lived in peace and harmony, their domains separated by the &ldquo;Words Worth&rdquo; tablet&mdash;a huge monolith slab erected by a guardian spirit. Although the tablet has writing on it, neither Tribe can read the text. One day, Words Worth was mysteriously destroyed by an unknown entity; its component parts scattered among the domain of the Tribes of Shadow.<br>\n<br>\nThe two Tribes blamed each other for the tablet&rsquo;s destruction, and started a war that has been on-going for 100 years.<br>\n<br>\nAstral, prince of the Tribe of Shadow, desires to become a Swordsman of Shadow but his father, King Wortoshika, forbids him to do so.

Desperate, Momoko even considers selling her most precious possession - her mother's ring... But everything changes when Takaaki, a charming young man in her class, generously offers to pay her tuition if she simply agrees to work off her debt by serving as his own, personal, live-in maid. At least, the offer sounded generous at first... <br><br>\nNow completely under Takaaki's control, Momoko has no choice but to satisfy his every twisted sexual fantasy. Yet Momoko isn't the only one he's drafting into this new maid service. Using blackmail and bribery, Takaaki's staff continues to grow with gorgeous young maids who are willing to serve him on their hands and knees. But even with all of this beauty surrounding him, for some inexplicable reason, Momoko still remains the target for his ever growing sadistic experiments. Could his unhealthy fixation lead to disaster? <br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

However, the principal who understood my way of teaching became sick, and hospitalized. Then, the vice-principal, Migiwa Anzu, took over the job. However, her educational policy was to make the students enter elite university, and my ideal education was broken. I was discouraged and became a bad teacher, and then even students began to make a fool of me. One day, I was scolded for the mistake I made in the class by the five female teachers who subordinated Ms. Migiwa. Then, I was dropped from homeroom teacher, and I began to just watch another teacher`s class. Since that day, my humiliating days began.<br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",
