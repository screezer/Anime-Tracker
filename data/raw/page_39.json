GASP is a upcoming band known for its violence, struggling to be noticed against the popularity of hotshot Aikawa, who's #1 on the charts and beloved by his fans. The Yaon Hibiya concert represents GASP's mainstream debut to break out of the small-time club scene, which is threatened by the schemes of Aikawa's manager, Ms. Kato of Koyama Productions. Kato wants To-Y to leave that \"bunch of hoodlums,\" and sing independently for a major label. <br><br>\nAdding to the confusion is an unexplained character who manifests feline traits, named Niya. Niya presents herself as \"To-Y's aijin\" (\"Niya, To-Y no aijin da yo!\") to the consternation of Koishikawa Hiderou, who has interest in To-Y. Koishikawa, also known as \"Sonoko-chan,\" is typed as a \"okama\" by Niya. A running motif is GASP, it's fans, and associates regarded as unusual by the mainstream public, as exemplified by their musical taste, dress, and Classic Coke-drinking, which only contributes to more difficulty in their struggle to be accepted.<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

If an operator and his or her navi are in a special enviroment known as a \"dimensional area\", they can fuse together in the real world via a technique called \"cross fusion\"! Yuuichirou's first test subject, Misaki Gorou, attempts the process and sadly fails. Netto offers to try with Rockman, but his father forbids it. Cross Fusion puts enormous strain on the operator's health, and battling in the real world could mean death. <br><br>\r\n(Source: Official Site)",

    "description": "Deep in the dark recesses of the UnderNet, Forte sleeps as he drifts aimlessly. In this cybernetic graveyard, a pulsating power re-awakens Forte, alerting him to a dangerous being shortly ahead. A haunting face appears amidst a massive bright purple blob, laughing directly at Forte. Cursing him, Forte finds himself powerless as the blob takes form, and captures him within its grasp!<br>\nNearing the time of sunset, a peaceful city and its people go about their everyday business. Curious bystanders on a sidewalk glimpse a shimmering purple light, which suddenly expands into tall pillar that reaches up to the sky. Screams erupt from the people as the pillar of light takes flight, absorbing everything in its destructive path. A tower clock dings the hour of 4 o'clock as the pillar desintigrates, leaving behind a trail of cybernetic residue and utter emptyness. <br>\n'The Program of Light and Dark'<br><br>\n(Source: Official Site)",

When the Japanese team arrives in Europe they meet incredible players with skills and strength they never had to face before. Shortly after the beginning of the match the Tachibana brothers shoot a goal with their \"acrobatic soccer\", but the Europeans have a supreme organisation and their legendary captain Karl-Heinz Schneider from Germany seems to be undefeatable. For Wakashimazu is totally overcharged with Schneider, the injured goalkeeper genius Wakabayashi takes his place and manages to stop Schneider's \"fire shots\".

With those lacks and Schneider's (the European's captain) improved skills, Tsubasa and the Japanese team have grave problems.

    "description": "The last Captain Tsubasa movie is about the match between Japan and Holland. After the Japanese team lost two games against this apparently supreme opponent, their confidence is at its lowest point and even Hyuga, having a hurt leg, is desperate. Thus the management tries everything to convince Wakabayashi (living in Germany) and Tsubasa (living in Brazil) to come to Holland and to help them, but both deny. Only in the second half of the third game Tsubasa appears and joins the team, giving them back their confidence and strength. With Tsubasa Ozora as their captain again, the last game ends 11:1 for Japan.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

    "description": "Shinichiro is a student living in what would be a dream come true for most high school boys, but for him is mostly a frustration. A well liked girl in school named Hiromi has lived in his house for a year along with his family. Her father was a close friend of the family, and when he died they immediately took her in. She is popular and well liked, always smiles, is talented in sports- but Shinichiro knows there must be tears inside her. Having an artistic tendency, he makes watercolours of her and thinks about wishing to ease her tears. Yet he cannot bring up the nerve to talk to her even in his own home. She, too, is quiet and withdrawn in their house, quite unlike at school. Shinichiro is also distracted by teasing from his friend Nobuse for watching Hiromi from afar, a curse of bad luck from a strange girl named Noe, and being forced to perform Muhiga dancing. By helping Noe he hopes to ease his own problems, yet he seems to have difficulty helping himself.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

However, since the drop-dead girl is Hime, daughter of the King of the Monsters, his \"reward\" is to come back as a not-quite-living soldier in her honor guard of horror! That means helping fight off the army of supernatural monstrosities Hime's siblings are unleashing against her in hopes of moving up the ladder of succession.<br><br>\nAnd if facing off with vampires and zombies isn't bad enough, how can anyone be prepared for the REALLY weird ones, like were-sharks, pandas and killer dumplings? This sure as hell isn't the afterlife Hiro was hoping for, but the really sad part is that Hime is the good girl in all of this... or at least as close to good as you can come when you're on the wrong side of the gates of hell!<br><br>\n(Source: RightStuf)",
