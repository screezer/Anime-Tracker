    "description": "This work was produced as the ninth special animated piece for the 24-hour television program by Tezuka Production, which took full charge of the original story, screenplay and direction. Tezuka Osamu crafts a love story in the time when humans are expanding into space at the end of the 21st century, employing an omnibus form similar to Bradbury's \"Martian Chronicle.\" The story line is similar to \"Phoenix: Nostalgia.\" Leaving the earth after marriage, a woman is left behind in space when her husband suddenly dies of a cosmic disease. These background details were used in \"The Phoenix\" as well. This time, her friends on the Earth head for space to save the woman who was once everyone's ideal lady. In this special animated piece, Tezuka Osamu emphasizes his basic concepts that \"love can save the earth\" and \"only love can save humans.\"<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Official Site)",

After being banished from the palace for fourteen years due to court intrigue, Prince Rama retreated to the forest with his beautiful wife Sita. Then, Rama, who had vanquished the demons of the forest, invites the wrath of the demon king Ravana, and his wife Sita is kidnapped. Rama goes to rescue Sita with the help of the monkey army. But while fighting the powerful Ravana army, his brother Lakshmana is seriously wounded. At this time, Hanuman, the general of the monkey army, flew to the Himalayas and carried a mountain of medicinal herbs that healed his wounds, saving his life. Eventually, Rama's army defeated Ravana's army using the \"Heavenly Weapons\" and returned to Ayodhya in triumph. ",

Run, who had executed these plans because of his partiality for his own self-made computer named Elena, lived together with Locke and Near under their protection. At the same time, Cassandra and Barcov of the Hackers netted the widely dispersed computers in each corner of space, and they succeeded in reviving some abandoned programs. This was the federal administrative computer, Elena. She tried to start the previous Imperial Plan again. When Locke found out about it, he set off to stop it. At the same time, the federal administration which detected something abnormal, also started to move. Involving Run and Near who chased Locke, the confusion was expanding to the entire Galaxy...<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

    "description": "The story revolves around the Tama River area, based mostly in Kawasaki City Kanagawa where battles are fought between the evil organisation Florsheim and the ally of justice Sunred. The twist is that Sunred (referred to most characters familiar with him as Red-san) is a rough-talking, violent and rude hero while the villains of Florsheim (led by General Vamp) are for the most part polite, conscientious and easy-going.<br><br>\nDespite this, both sides still stay true to their roles, with Florsheim dedicated to destroying Sunred and taking over the world while Sun Red battles against them. Other evil organisations and heroes are also mentioned from time to time.<br><br>\nEach episode is divided into various shorts of varying length. Most of the humour comes from the interactions of the characters, especially the main trio of Sunred, his girlfriend Kayoko and General Vamp. Kayoko and Vamp, for example, get along very well and she occasionally consults him about housework or cooking. In contrast, she and Sunred often argue like a long married couple.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Complicate things with a cat-eared dorm leader, her roommate’s rude-mannered maid and identical twin sister (who attends an all boys school, of course,) and WAY too many attractive girls of questionable persuasions and the question becomes whether Kanako can die from frustrated nosebleeds!
