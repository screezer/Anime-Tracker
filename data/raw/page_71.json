    "description": "Even as a young girl, Sara Iijima was a large-breasted woman. Because of this, she had felt self-conscious about herself... especially with men who were constantly leering at her. This only intensified when she was attacked by a rapist with a breast fetish. Although she escaped unharmed, this only made worse her insecurities. It was only because of the intervention of Dr. Chang that she was able to feel good about herself. Out of gratitude, Sara became Dr. Chang's protege in the method of psychic feedback, the method which was used to cure her of her insecurities.<br><br>\nHowever, Dr. Sara's method of therapy is vastly different than what Dr. Chang had used. By swinging her huge breasts in a circle, she is able to induce a hypnotic trance in her patients, after which she is able to learn what is bothering the patient and offer the proper solution. There is a risk of using this: Sara is often vulnerable to the sexual appetites of her patients and she must maintain control of the situation<br><br>\nSara is not alone, though. She is often accompanied by Tamine, a man who cannot seem to get a woman, no matter how he tries. But Tamine is devoted to Sara (mostly because of her huge breasts, which he is able to cop a feel whenever the chance arises), and aids her in helping others in need.",

Our hero, Akiyuki Takehara, lives on Sentan Island along with his mother Fusa. He is currently separated from his father, the town doctor Ryuzo, but the bond between father and son remains. One day, after taking Ryuzo the lunch that Fusa has made for him as usual, Akiyuki arrives at school, where he is caught up in an explosion along with his friends, Haru and Furuichi. The explosion produces a mysterious light, which enters Akiyuki's arm, causing him excruciating pain. He's given no time to understand it, however, as the white-haired girl who rode on the bus with him guides him to a power unlike anything he's ever known.",

    "description": "The second season of <i>Hayate no Gotoku!</i>.<br>\n<br>\nEver since he first met Nagi Sanzenin, Hayate Ayasaki's life has become increasingly more crazed and chaotic. Which is a bit of a problem, since, as the eccentric heiress' butler/personal bodyguard, he's theoretically supposed to be a stabilizing and protective influence. Unfortunately, Nagi and her friends attract trouble the way dropped lollipops attract dirt, and if Hayate has to take a couple of nasty licks along the way, that's just part of the job. The real sucker punch, though, is that Nagi's increasing attraction to Hayate himself is getting precariously close to transforming their professional relationship into something far less professional and much more like a relationship. Is Hayate up for the emotional perils of a round of \"upstairs, downstairs\"? Or will the purely physical dangers of life on Her Majesty's Domestic Service do him in first?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

When he was 15 years old, he happens to prove that he is the person to be the king of all Britain, by drawing out the sacred sword, Excalibur, which no other men was succeeded to draw out from the iron stand. But in order to become a real king, he has to beat Lavic who is under the protection of Medessa, an evil witch. Merlin tells Arthur that he has to find out the Holy Shield to bend King Lavic and Medessa. Thus, Arthur goes on a journey to seek the Holy Shield. On the way he runs into four boy knights - Lancelot, Perceval, Tristan and Guerrehet, who hold up the same ideals as he does. They make a pilgrimage from one country to another in search for the Holy Shield, helping some common people who are distressed by bad aristocrats under the influence of Lavic, and subjugating some bandits. Arthur and his knights continue to travel to achieve their end, i.e., the reconstruction of an ideal country, Kingdom of Logres.",

Shoutarou accepts the V-controller and duty that his father intended for the giant robot, Tetsujin: to fight evil and keep the peace. As the youngest member of Interpol, Shoutarou’s adventures take him around the world, under the sea, through time, and the deepest reaches of space. His mentors are Dr. Shikishima, his father’s brilliant colleague, and Inspector Ohtsuka, the sometimes buffoonish chief Interpol liaison, but in someways, Shoutarou is closest to his giant avatar, Tetsujin. Together, they battle various menaces, from mad scientists to pirates to ninjas to international criminals, all with their own unique giant robots, but the deadliest villain that Shoutarou and Tetsujin build up to is the Space Demon King, an alien so powerful that he threatens to swallow up the Solar System.<br><br>\n(Source: Discotek)",

Okon enters her home and Itako tells the fox that he is welcome to take anything that he wants, for she has no use for anything anymore. Okon is delighted and in order to return the favour (the act of ongaeshi), Okon performs a magic jy&#333;ruri (a ballad with shamisen accompaniment) that heals Itako so that she is fit enough to walk again. Everyone is surprised by Itako's sudden recovery. She then hears of a hunter who has been badly injured and is near death. Itako hides Okon in the back of her shirt and has the fox sing the song while she plays shamisen in order to heal the man. This act of kindness is repeated for others until Itako's good fortune leads some to be suspicious of her. <br>\n(Source: Nishikata Film Review)",
