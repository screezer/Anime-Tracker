    "description": "When demons walk the streets, the cops need to recruit more demons!<br><br>\nIn a town where humans and demons co-exist, it takes more than a normal police force to maintain the peace. Enter the Hiizumi Life Counseling Office, a fantastic foursome of unique teenagers, each gifted with an amazing super power! Since it sometimes takes real demon-fire to fight demon fire, the first three quarters of the team aren't exactly human: Ao, a cat-eared telepath; Kotoha, a half-human conjuror; and Hime, descended from a dragon (and the town's acting mayor), all of whom also happen to be delightfully female.<br><br>\nRounding out the group is the token male and human, Akina, the office director and \"Oyakume,\" capable of banishing spirits permanently (and from their point of view quite fatally) via a process called tuning. They may not look as impressive as some other superhero teams, and they certainly don't have the most dynamic name ever, but come hell hounds or high water, but they will defend their city!<br><br>\n(Source: RightStuf)",
