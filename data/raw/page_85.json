Below is a summary of the events within the 20 minute movie. <br><br>\nThe story focuses on an elite unit of 5 UBCS members, sent into Raccoon City to try and rescue Dr. Cameron. An Umbrella scientist lost in all the confusion. The UBCS team, consisting of members Rodrigo, Roger, Klaus, Ed and Norman, have a GPS device used to track down Dr. Cameron&rsquo;s last known location, which is near a large food factory. <br><br>\nUpon entering the factory they are attacked by a large creature, a sort of hybrid between a Tyrant and the more evolved forms of Nemesis. <br><br>\n(Source: rehorror.net) ",

At last the war came to an end, the two parties reached an amicable settlement, and a great party of friendship was held. But when it came to the turn of the bats to perform in the program, their fence-straddling tactics were exposed, and everyone refused to associate with them.

Her mother, Sayoko, is a famous fashion designer and has scored a job for the family to shoot a TV production; a rare opportunity for the family to be together and enjoy themselves. The girls travel to a small, isolated village in late August and the filming begins. Little do Miu and her family know however, the entire production is a scheme. This is the time for a local festival and they happened to unwillingly volunteer to be a key figure for this festival; the Shishigami. One by one, the girls are subjected to the traditions of the festival, experiencing first-hand just how serious it is.<br><br>\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

That&rsquo;s when Kenji discovers his \"summer job\" is to pretend to be Natsuki's fiance and dance with her at the birthday celebration. <br><br>\nAs Kenji attempts to keep up with Natsuki's act around her family, he receives a strange math problem on his cell phone which, being a math genius, he can't resist solving. As it turns out, the solution to the mysterious equation causes Oz, the program that controls nearly every aspect of life to be hacked into, it's up to Kenji and his new \"family\" to stop the hacker before it's too late.<br><br>\n(Source: twitchfilm.net)",
