Though they had to pay a heavy price for their success in a catastrophic accident that the world only wants to forget about. However, all is not well as the secret organization Big Fire is hell-bent on taking over the world. They have obtained two of three mysterious Shizuma drive samples with an unknown function, which are an integral part of their world domination plans. The third sample has however been stolen by Dr. Shizuma who during his escape is saved by Daisaku, Giant Robo and the Experts of Justice. Then a desperate struggle begins between the Experts of Justice and Big Fire for the control of the last sample as Big Fire unleashes their mightiest weapon, the Eye of Volger, upon the unsuspecting world.

    "description": "Aramis fell off her horse and received the aid of a man named Francois. They fell in love with each other at first sight and spent their time happily for a while. Francois was killed by Manson and the Ironmask`s people, so Aramis swore revenge. Then she went to Paris to be a musketeer.<br><br>\n1 year after the end of TV series, D'Artagnan had a drink with 3 musketeers and found that Jussac and the Cardinal's Guards harrassed a woman in a tavern in Paris. Of couse, they fought Jussac and the Cardinal`s guards and won. On his way to home, D'Artagnan witnessed the woman whom he rescued from Jussac about to jump into the river, and rescued her again. D'Artagnan brought her to home but she disappeared soon. After a day, D'Artagnan heard that the woman was killed last night and Rochefort and Cardinal's guards arrested him for murder because his hat was found by the woman's body. Aramis discovers that the story has a link with Catherine de M&eacute;dicis, and launches out an investigation. This one will bring back her to the castle of her beloved where she will have to face Pizzaro to protect a dangerous document.<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

Two other races exist in this world: the Makai (a demon race) and the Juujinkai (a half-man, half-beast race). Once every 3,000 years, a supreme being known as the \"Choujin\" (Overfiend) will emerge and bring balance to all three realms on Earth. In present-day Japan, after 300 years of endless searching, a Jujinkai named Amano Jyaku has discovered the presence of the Choujin inside high school slacker Tatsuo Nagumo. But now, Amano, along with his sister Megumi and their sidekick Kuroko, must protect Nagumo and his new girlfriend Akemi Ito from the Makai, who believe that Nagumo is not the Choujin, but an evil entity bent on destroying all living beings on Earth.

    "description": "Only one episode of this was partially completed, the released version containing numerous examples of animation that is missing in-between frames. The story as such concerned the arrival of the real Chojin as he/she (a hermaphrodite) makes moves to wipe out all life on Earth.<br><br>\nInterestingly, the setup for the show was far more heavily connected with the first two, more popular, chapters in the Urotsukidoji saga, with appearances by Nagumo and Akemi (unseen since the early episodes of Part III), and redesigned character models that more closely resembled the earlier episodes. Some of the less popular characters introduced in chapters III and IV, particularly Buju, were nowhere to be seen. Nevertheless, such strategies did little to get this final saga off the ground and the story was shelved.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

In fact, they are so strong that humans do not stand a chance against them in a fight. <br><br>\nThe only thing strong enough to defeat a demon is another demon, and it is through this logic that Ryo Asuka hatches the plan to have his good-hearted friend, Akira Fudo, possessed by a demon. If a person is of pure of heart, then they might be able to control the demon that possesses them, and thereby acquire power equal to a demon. After raising some hell in a club, the plan works, and Akira is possessed by the powerful demon known as Amon. <br><br>\nNow Akira is humanity's sole champion of justice against the hidden demon menace that has plagued humanity since the dawn of time.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

Soon, many settlers started to resent the EFG's and its sphere of influence, straining the relationship between the central government and the colonies.<br><br>\nWhile a strained peace was being forged between Earth and the colonies, a race of non-human creatures known as Deathcula invaded the System.

In order to have a chance at survival, Dr. Charles Louvre developed a transformable starship known as the Bismarck.<br><br>\nKnowing that an advanced team of specialists were required to operate the Bismarck, four individuals came together and were charged with keeping the outer colonies safe from further Deathcula attacks.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Advances in genetic engineering and cybernetics have created an environment full of artificially enhanced humans and intelligent super-computers that operate using biological software.

Equipped with state-of-the-art armored cybernetic suits known as \"variable gears,\" only this special law-enforcement arm can deal with virus-infected war machines on their own terms.<br>\n<br>\nBut when a prototype armored gear is infected with a new virus during its unveiling, STAND has its hands full. Not only must they contend with the rouge machine, but a mysterious stranger know as Serge appears on the scene with his sights firmly fixed on STAND's leader, Raven. Fascinated with the young man's potential, Raven arranges for Serge to be unwittingly fitted with one of STAND's variable gears. Not only is Serge's thirst for vengeance corrected through this gambit, but the young man's latent battle skills are awakened in time for him to soundly defeat the hostile prototype.<br>\n<br>\nIn the wake of the battle, Serge is invited to join STAND. But what is the secret behind Serge's phenomenal strength and skill? What secrets do his past hold? And just what is his connection to the sinister \"Incubator\" - the self-aware orbital space station bent upon replacing humanity with its infected offspring?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Manga Entertainment)",
