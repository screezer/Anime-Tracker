Everyone aboard is killed instantly - except Akito Kobayashi - owner of the devilish program and sworn ally of hell itself.<br><br>\nKojiro Soma, an old elementary school friend of Akito`s, is surprised to see him enroll back in school. Kojiro notices how this once lonely boy has grown into a suave and arrogant teenager. Later, when his classmates are attacked and legendary demons return to stalk to streets of Tokyo, Kojiro begins to truly understand what his old friend has become.<br><br>\nAkito has plans for the human race. The plans revolve around magnetite, the mysterious element that forms the living essence of every human soul. Combined with his demonic software, a strong enough source of magnetite would release a plague of devils upon the Earth. That source exists in Kojiro`s class, but when the evil plan expands beyond even Akito`s grasp, it is Kojiro who must find the ultimate power within himself, and go head-to-head with the greatest demon of all!<br><br>\n(Source: AniDB)",

Hazuma, an ex-cop who now runs his own detective agency, is hired to track down a missing scientist alleged to have made off with cybernetics from Professor Tani's laboratory. The missing hardware is reappearing as psycho-activated weapons grafted onto the bodies of the rogue \"cyper-junkies.\" During his investigation Hazuma is brutally murdered. Dr. Tani uses Hazuma as a bio-template to replace the missing 8 Man. As a cover, 8 Man maintains the original persona of the detective, yet must cope with the duality of the cynical private eye and maintain the balance as an emotionless super-android hero.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

A new city, MegaTokyo, was then recreated due in no small part from the aid of a multi-million dollar company, Genom Corp. Genom created and mass-produced biomechanical creatures called Boomers to aid in the restoration of MegaTokyo. When the Boomers began to run out of control, the ADPolice at first tried to stop them, but they proved to be far more difficult to deal with than was first imagined. Under the ever looming Boomer threat, a group of four girls from varying degrees of society banded together. Calling themselves The Knight Sabers, they were the only ones with enough firepower and resourcefulness to defend the fledgling MegaTokyo from Genom and it's berserk Boomers.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

One cop, known as Angel, is the best of the best, stopping at nothing in her fight for justice. Things get interesting for Angel Cop and her new partner when they begin investigating a series of murders in which the victims are other criminals, killed in very unpleasant ways. These criminals, a group of psychics that banded together to hunt down the lowest scum in the city, and bring them to justice. After a couple of encounters between the cops and the psychics, two of the psychics begin to think that maybe they're not the good guys after all, but the third prefers killing to morality. Augmented by cybernetics from a mysterious source, he heads out on a killing spree, with Angel as his first target. Even with help from the other two psychics and her newly cyborged partner (after an unfortunate accident), Angel is going to have her work cut out trying to find the rogue psychic and the organization behind him.

GGG - with Guy Shishio and the newly-constructed GaoFighGar - team up with their French counterpart Chasseur to battle the evil organization BioNet. Among Chasseur`s ranks is Renais Cardiff Shishioh - a former BioNet cyborg with the relentless pursuit of destroying those who took away her humanity. But as GGG and Chasseur fight the BioNet, GGG`s bases around the world are suddenly attacked, and the recently-discovered \"Q-Parts\" and the original Gao Machines are stolen by Mamoru Amami, who has been abducted and cloned by an even greater threat known as the \"Eleven Kings of Sol.\" Evicted from Earth by the United Nations, GGG must now travel to the far reaches of the galaxy to battle the Eleven Kings of Sol and save Mamoru before it`s too late.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",
