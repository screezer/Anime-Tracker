Because so-called \"memory trading\" now occurs, it is now possible to steal memories and illegally alter them.<br><br>\nSociety has fallen apart as authority has become lost and stagnant.<br><br>\nOne day, a man awakens in a ruined room. His name is Kaiba. He has no memories, but he does have a pendant with a picture of an unknown woman inside.<br><br>\nIn the skies are roiling clouds and electrical storms, impossible to pass without losing one's memories; above them lies the elusive realm of the rich and powerful, who barter others' bodies and memories for their own enjoyment and longevity. Below lies a troubled and dangerous world where good bodies are hard to come by and real money is scarce.<br><br>\nAfter suddenly being attacked, Kaiba escapes into space, and during his travels meets all sorts of people and regains his memories. Throughout it, he continues to be troubled by the world's problems, as well as his own existence. And what of the woman in the pendant, Neiro?",

There's just one catch. That \"hottest ticket\" is just a meal ticket, and beneath the makeup, these ultimate head-bangers are hired doppelgangers who don't even LIKE what they do! Jaggi is actually Wada, who wants to play glam rock; Camus is Nishida, an anime fan with an appalling weakness for curry and NSFW videos; and Krauser is... oh the shame... street-singing Soichi Negishi, whose dreams of singing happy pop hits seem hopelessly doomed by the success of his rage-fueled alter ego! Worse, he can't even tell anyone who Krauser is. Not even the girl he likes, who HATES DMC! Will rage against the corporate machine consume Negishi's tortured soul? Is there life after death metal? What it's like to put your head in a jet engine and turn up the volume? <br><br>\r\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks) ",

    "description": " Kitarou is a youkai boy born in a cemetery, and aside from his mostly-decayed father, the last living member of the Ghost tribe. He is missing his left eye, but his hair usually covers the empty socket. He fights for peace between humans and youkai, which generally involves protecting the former from the wiles of the latter.<br><br>\nThis version of the Kitarou story is based on the original Hakaba Kitarou manga, the manga which inspired the popular Gegege no Kitarou series in the late 60's.<br><br>\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

Climbing the beanstalk, Jack encounters a strange and remarkable world ruled by the magical Princess Margaret. The princess is in love with Prince Tulip despite his unattractive features and harsh personality, but as it turns out, this is the work of Madam Noir, an evil witch who has cast a spell on the princess so she will marry Tulip, her only son. Can Jack help the princess avoid this awful fate?

The only problem is that Irie is the smartest student in school in contrast to Kotoko being one of the dumbest. Now in her 3rd year of high school, she still isn't there. However, one day her home gets destroyed and the only place left to go to is Irie's home. Now that she lives close to him, will their relationship be the same, or will it become greater than it is?",

    "description": "A gigantic meteorite landed on earth a few years back. A mysterious capsule believed to have belonged to the aliens was discovered. Called the \"black box,\" an international organization called \"Project BB\" was created to research it.<br><br>\nEight boys, including Manabu Yoshimura, attend International Academy, a school located near Project BB headquarters.   They are enticed by their teacher Toukichi Hashiba's promise of \"I'll give you class credit\",  and end up getting  involved in his experiment. The experiment was to enter the eight empty chambers of meteorite. According to Hashiba's theory, the meteorite should strongly respond to strong human thoughts. He tells them to have a clear image of a great looking gigantic robot; if they do, something should happen...<br><br>\n Then, a big spaceship appears in the sky and an alien calling himself Wercury appears in a 3-D image. He tells them he is from the Star of Prokimasi and that he has come to collect the meteorite of the Choshin people. If they do not hand it over, he will challenge the earth beings to a battle. Manabu and his friends are confused by the unexpected turn of events but the meteorite responds to the thoughts of the group and suddenly starts to transform itself into a  gigantic robot. Then, attacked by the invading Prokimasi robot, they are forced to pull their strength together and fight back. But it is extremely difficult to put the wills of the eight together as one and the robot cannot fight in the way it should. The gigantic robot that Hashiba named \"Gakusaver\" and Manabu's eight; can they manage to protect Earth and the meteorite from the Prokimasi invasion?  <br><br>\n(Source: King Records)",

    "description": "This film stays very faithful to the original down to the smallest details, save for the kangaroo-rat that suddenly appears twenty minutes into the movie and subsequently follows Aladdin around, serving no purpose in the story but fulfilling the role of token animal mascot. <br><br>\nThe screenwriter needs no introduction; Akira Miyazaki single-handedly wrote five of the classic WMT series, including Perrine and Rascal, and participated in two others. The only other name among the staff that rings a bell, though, is Yukihide Takekawa, who was responsible for the music in the magnificent and unknown Unico pilot film. <br><br>\nThe story takes some illogical and confusing jumps at the point where Aladdin begins to court the princess, and the extravagant animation that had characterised Toei films of the 60s, when Toei had the best animators around, had become a thing of the past long before this point; but this is still an above-average film, in large part because of the screenplay that stays so faithful to the original. The character designs are slightly more western-looking than one is accustomed to seeing in anime. <br><br>\n(Source: pelleas.net)",

    "description": "It has been three years since the end of the series. Ryo works for NASA as an engineer on a large rocket project. Anise, fellow Borgman and lover, has been reduced to flipping burgers in a restaurant. So naturally, when she gets a letter offering her a professional job in a big, Japanese, high-tech project, she jumps at the chance. Ryo, however, is as indecisive as ever and so she leaves for Japan without him.<br><br>\nChuck Sweager, the third Borgman, is a police officer, as is his girlfriend Miki. When she witnesses a fight amongst several cyborgs she tells Chuck, who says flatly that it cannot be possible, since the only living cyborgs are Ryo, Anise, and himself. But she convinces him and they investigate. Anise arrives for her new job, and when they meet for dinner they explain the situation to her. Anise volunteers to sneak around the Heaven's Gate project, which they believe to be the source of these new cyborgs. Ryo, meanwhile, is en route to Japan to go after his girlfriend. Accompanying him is Hussan, one of the two surviving researchers on the Borgman Project, who has been asked to appear before the Tokyo Police to help investigate. Once the entire cast is in Japan, things begin to get complicated. <br><br>\n(Source: ex.org)",

    "description": "Based on the erotic game by Candy Soft.<br>\n<br>\nMy name is Kuya Hiiragi. Actually, I have six elder sisters. The eldest sister is Hinano Ne-san although she looks quite young. She is always worrying about that, so if she is treated like a child, she gets angry. The second sister is Kaname Onee-sama. She is a popular lawyer and is known as the \"Icy Lawyer\". In fact, she is my first love. The third is Serori Ne-Ne. She is half Japanese and half North European. She has the most voluptuous body of all the sisters, but her behavior is very childish. The fourth is Tomoe Ne. Although she looks quite stern, she is actually quite gentle and gets teased by the other sisters. The fifth is Takane Aneki. She is highhanded, and treats me like a servant. She often beats me. The youngest sister is Umi Oneechan. She takes care of me a lot, and devotes much love to me.<br><br>\nWhen I was a child, I was adopted by the Hiiragi family. But because the father was afraid that the sisters would spoil me, I was sent to a relative to train myself. It is the first time I`ve gone home since then. I was very excited to see them again, especially Kaname, my first love.<br><br>\nThey welcomed me home, but late at night, Kaname Onee-sama raped me, and treated me like a toy. I felt very ashamed and I made up my mind to train my sex technique to put her to shame...with the help of the other sisters.<br><br>\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",
