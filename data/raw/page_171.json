When his father dies under mysterious circumstances, he is made aware of his father's secret identity; a famous international criminal known as International Criminal 1412: the Phantom Thief, and that he was murdered by a mysterious organization for refusing to aid them in retrieving the \"Pandora Gem\"; a mystical stone said to shed a \"tear\" during the passing of a particular comet (often called the 'Volley Comet'), the consumption of which bestows immortality. <br>\n<br>\nHe vows to prevent the organization from gaining immortality, and assumes his father's identity as he begins his quest for the gem. His only clues as to the gem's location are that it glows red under the full moon and that it is a doublet: a gem hidden within a larger gem. Thus, it would have to be a relatively large one with a bizarre history, and always stored in a place that never receives moonlight. He thus researches and steals famous priceless gems with odd histories from incredibly well-defended areas, and always returns them after the very next full moon.<br>",

Caster’s plans have been set in motion, beginning with taking Saber captive while Rin and Archer go their separate ways to continue their fights on their own. Without Saber’s aid, Shirou’s principles are put to the ultimate test. With many battles to come with expected and unexpected enemies, Shirou’s resolve begins to take form. Is his desire to protect people and become a hero, genuine? Or are they simply borrowed feelings? And will it be enough to carry him to the end?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Aniplex of America)",

    "description": "<i>The second season of Kamisama Hajimemashita</i><br>\n<br>\nNanami Momozono and her familiars Tomoe and Mizuki have survived quite a few challenges since Nanami took up the mantle of Mikage Shrine's patron god. Naturally, the wind god Otohiko comes to invite Nanami to the Divine Assembly in Izumo, the home of the gods, and Nanami chooses to take Mizuki with her, leaving Tomoe to pose as her at school. However, she has an ulterior motive for attending the Divine Assembly: to discover the whereabouts of the missing Lord Mikage, the former god of the shrine.<br>\n<br>\nAfter her adventures in Izumo, Nanami meets Botanmaru, a tengu child looking for someone she knows all too well—tengu turned goth idol Shinjirou Kurama. Botanmaru needs Shinjirou, their prince, to return home to Mount Kurama and stop the tyranny of Jirou, who has taken over the rule of their hometown. However, Nanami soon discovers a force much darker than Jirou is at work on the mountain.<br>\n<br>\nAs a fledgling god becoming more accustomed to divinity, Nanami finds herself dealing with a tengu rebellion, her blooming feelings for Tomoe, and a strange man with ties to both Tomoe's past and Nanami's future.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: MAL Rewrite)",

And nearly three years have passed since the final battle between Hikari Yagami's group and BelialVamdemon. As the peaceful days passed by, at some point the gate to the Digital World closed. Not even the DigiDestined know what caused this, and time alone continues to pass.<br>\n<br>\nOn one such day, a Kuwagamon suddenly appears in Odaiba. Its rampage leaves the town in ruins, and the people there in turmoil. Taichi happens to catch sight of the Kuwagamon, and he chases after it all by himself in an effort to halt its rampage. But there's nothing he can do against a Kuwagamon.<br>\n<br>\n<i>\"It's no use... I can't do anything about this alone...\"</i><br>\nJust as the Kuwagamon roars and attacks Taichi, his Digivice begins to emit a bright light...<br>\n<br>\n<i>\"Taichi, look how big you've grown!\"</i><br>\nWith the sound of that nostalgic voice, the story once again begins to move in a big way.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Official Website)",

    "description": "Once upon a time, five girls made an animated film and it was so much fun that they pledged to get jobs in animation so that someday they could make another film together. Now, two years later, Aoi, Shizuka, Ema, Misa and Midori have learned the truth about the anime industry: it's not always fun, it's anything but easy, and having talent isn't always enough to open the right doors.<br>\n<br>\nWhich is why Aoi's overwhelmed by her job as a production assistant, Shizuka's waiting on tables between auditions, Midori's currently scriptless, Misa's switched to C.G., and Ema's working long hours as a key animator. Is it what they imagined? No. But are they ready to give up? Not just yet! Sometimes, when things happen in animation, they can happen in the most wonderful ways!<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

The previous series each adopted a different motif: the Hissatsu Series for Braiger, the Shinsengumi for Baxingar, and Around the World in 80 Days for Sasuraiger.

    "description": "This new TV special tells the two years of Luffy's training with Silvers Rayleigh in Rusukaina Island after the Battle of Marineford, which has never been told in the manga or TV anime. It also features a new villain named Burndy World who is known as \"The Destroyer of the World\" and has the power of the MoaMoa Fruit (its ability is still unknown). Luffy has to protect Boa Hancock from the new enemy who escaped from the level 6 of Impel Down. He is newly designed by the original creator of the manga, Eiichiro Oda.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",
