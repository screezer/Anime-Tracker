    "description": "<b>Episode 1</b><br>\n<br>\n<i>Yudetate Konyoku Onsen Tamago</i><br>\nKaeda Endou loves hot springs more than romance, fashion and studying. Kaede decided to visit the famous \"Minekura Onsen\" for their hot springs. Thinking that it was a female only bath she got right in only to be surprised when three older men joined her. She tried to keep her cool but ended up overheating which allowed the older men to take advantage of the naive Kaede's body.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Osouji no Jikan</i><br>\nMiwa is a clean freak who can't stand the thought of being touched by others. This upset her classmates who plotted their revenge against her. Covered in garbage and stuffed two at a time from both ends, she is dirtied by her classmates as they have their revenge.<br>\n<br>\n<b>Episode 2</b><br>\n<br>\n<i>Shoujo Janai Mon!</i><br>\nThanks to her peers at school, Tooyama Haruka thinks her being a virgin is the reason she's unpopular. She decides to make a change and posts on a dating site's message board, \"Please take my virginity!\" When Haruka arrives at the place she specified, there are more men than she could ever imagine! She has sex for her first time and thoroughly enjoys it. She ends up not sleeping that night, instead having sex with reckless abandon with everyone present.<br>\n<br>\n<i>Shisen no Mezame</i><br>\nThe landlord's daughter, Kanata Haruno, is very shy. She can't keep a conversation with her classmates. The landlord wants to help her, so she asks one of the apartment's residents, Nakada Shin, if he'll try being her daughter's counselor. Latching onto Haruno's fear of having others look at her, he tries to help her by using exposure therapy. He has her change into an erotic costume and begins devouring her with his eyes. From only a few minutes of Nakada's gaze, Haruno has an orgasm. That's right, being watched turns her on! Maybe getting used to the most embarrassing thing she knows of, having sex, will help her!",

However, when forced to retire from the team and to leave his gaming career behind, he finds work at a nearby internet café. There, when Glory launches its 10th server, he throws himself into the game once more using a new character named \"Lord Grim.\"\n\nXiu Ye's early achievements on the new server immediately catch the attention of many players, as well as the big guilds, leaving them to wonder about the identity of this exceptional player. However, while he possesses 10 years of experience and in-depth knowledge, starting afresh with neither sponsors nor a team in a game that has changed over the years presents numerous challenges. Along with talented new comrades, Xiu Ye once again dedicates himself to traversing the path to Glory's summit.",
