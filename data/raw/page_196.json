    "description": "A movie by The Tohoku Regional Development Association which was made in order to raise earthquake awareness. The anime consists of two parts titled \"Sonaeru\" (Prepare) and \"Manabu\" (Learn), focusing on true stories from Iwate prefecture's Fudai village and Kamaishi City.<br><br>\n\"Sonaeru\" is set during the 1970s to 1980s, and focuses on the story of Kotoku Wamura, the mayor of the village Fudai at the time, as he attempts to persuade the village assembly that his proposed floodgate and seawall project is not useless. He remembers the 1896 and 1933 Sanriku earthquakes and tsunamis in proposing the project. The 15.5-meter (51-foot) floodgate — the highest in the Tohoku region — ends up sparing Fudai the damage that the 2011 tsunami subjected other coastal towns.<br><br>\n\"Manabu\" centers on elementary school children in Kamaishi City during the 2011 disaster, illustrating their lessons learned in disaster readiness to head to higher ground. The story will show \"Tsunami Tendenko,\" a local custom telling people to individually seek higher ground on their own initiative, in a lesson that the children would teach their parents.\n<br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

One day, a rookie adventurer named Ran comes up to him in the Guild Hall asking for a handshake. She's apparently become a fan of Kazuma after his consecutive defeat of the Devil King's generals! This puts him in an amazing mood, but it's not long before the Guild receptionist Luna appears, asking him to take on a quest to eliminate a golem. Wanting to look good in front of a fan, Kazuma ends up accepting, and heads towards ancient ruins with Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness in tow.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

Tanmoku Ki appears and asks You Keika to make a “pact” with him to fight Evil Spirits together.

There were 20 episodes at 14 minutes each. A Japanese dub was then produced by Haoliner's Japanese branch, Emon, which aired on TV in Winter 2017 under the title Spiritpact. Each TV episode was comprised of two ONA episodes with minor aesthetic touch-ups. Thus, the Japanese (and Crunchyroll-licensed) version has 10 episodes at 24 minutes each.</i>",

The story begins when toys of Oban, a character from a tokusatsu (special effects) television show, becomes popular, but also loses popualrity quickly. Many unsold Oban toys are thrown away. A bolt of lightning strikes one of these toys one day, and gives it life. Alongside other toys thrown away by people, Oban swears revenge on humans, and attacks. At the same time, Oban's sworn enemy Chūkōnen Kamen is also given life. Chūkōnen Kamen, normally a middle-aged, overweight, and depressed man, powers up by eating cup noodles. Alongside Shinnosuke, he will fight to reclaim peace for the world.",
