    "description": "Rei Kiriyama is a 17 year old boy who recently started living alone, financed by his salary as a professional Shogi player. Despite his independence, however, he's yet to mature emotionally, and his problems continue to haunt him in his daily life. His relationship with his adoptive family is strained, and he has difficulties interacting with his fellow high school students.<br>\n<br>\nMeanwhile, his professional career in Shogi has entered a slump. Burdened with the heavy expectations placed upon him, his wins and losses are fluctuating as his record and progression into the ranks begin to stagnate.<br>\n<br>\nAcquainted with Rei are the three Kawamoto sisters: Akari, Hinata, and Momo. Unlike Rei, they live happily in their modest home, which they warmly welcome Rei into as if he were one of their own.  He frequently visits the family, interacting with them and receiving the kind of care and affection he never quite had while under his foster home.<br>\nThis is the story of Rei's triumphs and failures, relationships new and old, and his growth as a person.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: TV Tropes)",

They were helpless to fight against them and resigned themselves to imminent death. At that time, an ultimate weapon which could create items out of imagination was discovered in a expansive cave under Japan, along with its young master Ryuusei who was in cryostasis. The indiscriminate alien attacks awoke him and he led the humans to a decisive victory.<br>\n<br>\nOne year later, while the areas which had been destroyed by the aliens were still being rebuilt, Ryuusei was appointed as the commander of the newly-formed Defence Force of Earth, which was created to fight against space invaders. However, he was the only person who could use the ‘imagination embodiment device’. If something was to happen to him, then calamity would befall the world. So the Defence Force of Earth decided to recruit girls with potential to fight alongside him. Even though they hesitated at first, they each had their own reasons to join Ryuusei. Thus, the special force ‘Blade Briders’ was formed, to protect the Earth against the aliens who have returned.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Visual Novel Database)",

To restore order, the World Council is formed. As peace is restored, the Divine Gate becomes an urban legend.<br>\n<br>\nIn that world, boys and girls deemed fit by the World Council are gathered. They are ones who aim to reach the gate for their personal objectives. Those who reach the gate can remake the world.<br>\n<br>\nWhat lies beyond the gate? When they reach the door, will the world change? Will it be the past that changes, or will it be the future?<br>\n<br>\n(Source: MAL News)",

However, while most of the city appears to be rural, there are many traditional city elements as well. While set in a modern setting, the city also gives off a strange sense of nostalgia.\n<br><br>\nTennouji Kotarou lives here. He's a high school student who has the ability to rewrite his own body; he can become stronger and faster at any time he chooses. He investigates supernatural mysteries with five girls from his school.\n<br><br>\n(Source: VNDB)<br><br>\n<i>Note: The first episode aired with a runtime of 48 minutes as opposed to the standard 24 minute long episode.</i>",

    "description": "Second season of Gakusen Toshi Asterisk.<br><br>\n\nLess than a century ago a meteor collided with the planet's surface and the resulting disaster caused the next generation of humanity to develop a wide variety of amazing abilities. In the center of the meteor's crater lies Rikka, a system of six academies known as the Asterisk. Ayato Amagiri enters the Asterisk as a transfer student hoping to compete in a special battle event known as the Festa. However, he quickly finds himself on the bad side of one of the strongest fighters around—the beautiful but fiery Julis-Alexa von Riessfeld. To stand against her he'll have to rely on his own sword-wielding ability, but when the tables turn, will they be able to team up to take down the competition? <br><br>\n(Source: Anime News Network)",

    "description": "Due to the destruction of nature, the disruption of ecosystem, and also massive wars using nuclear bombs and biological weapons since 20 centuries, the earth fell into ruins. The ground was collapsed and polluted, and many kinds of plants and animals became extinct. The earth encountered the 6th mass extinction: The Big Six. During the time, humans built the aero police to save endangered species. In this isolated city in the sky, various animals evolved over the years through genetically modified mating. As a result, they started walking on two legs and acquired language. Today, they have built a civilization and lead peaceful lives. No one thinks of the outside, the terrestrial world any more――\nOne day, kids on the aero police find an unknown seed from the outside. And their adventure in the unseen terrestrial world starts! ――Without knowing that once they go down to the ground, they will never be able to come back…\n\n<br><br>\n(Source: STUDIO 4℃)\n<br>\n<br>\n<i>Note: UTOPA is one of four Anime Tamago 2016 young animator training projects.",

It was an enormous box-shaped island built by the government and referred to as \"Tokyo Kingdom.\" <br>\n<br>\nThere was hope that it would become a second city center floating at sea, but it had failed to attract businesses. <br>\n<br>\nThe only way of getting to and from the island was through Honshu Island over the 10 kilometer Tokyo Kingdom bridge. Unfortunately, this narrow route was the means in which the inhabitants of hell found their way onto the island, luring anarchists, criminals, and even illegal immigrants there, transforming the streets of the sea bound city into a world-renowned haven for danger. <br>\n<br>\nHowever abandoned the streets were, order did exist in such a place despite it being a breeding place of crime. <br>\n<br>\nThere was a business district at the heart as well as one of Asia's greatest prostitute grottoes. Whether or not it was only the strong who survived, the viability of living there required one not to be careless in making friends with the strong.<br>\n<br>\n(Source: Dark Translations)",

A next-gen wearable device, the Augma doesn't have a full-dive function like its predecessors. Instead, it uses Augmented Reality to get players into the game. It is safe, user-friendly and lets users play while they are conscious, making it an instant hit on the market. The most popular game on the system is “Ordinal Scale” (aka: OS), an ARMMORPG developed exclusively for the Augma.<br><br>\n\nAsuna and the gang have already been playing OS for a while, by the time Kirito decides to join them.
